# Investigator-Django
A Django website with the goal of making academic searches easy!


Navigating academic search engines to find investigations, magazines and papers can get tedious due to old designs and slow loading times. 

Investigator allows you to make a single search in six pages at the same time and display them in a single website. 

The search engines chosen are Google Scholar, Research Gate, Base Search, Pubmed, Elsevier and Libgen, but more can be added if need arises.

The website is in a working state at the moment, but I intend to polish the visuals and speedup with multiprocessing, besides of configurations so it can be hosted.

At the moment, it uses Bootstrap; requests, lxml and bs4 for scraping; os and pool for multiprocessing (on the next release). 



## Clarifications

* The project was made without any monetary gain in mind.
* I have no connection to any of the search engines mentioned beforehand and in the code.
* If for any reason any of the webpages involved or their representatives require it, the code will be taken down or modified.
